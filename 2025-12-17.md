> add the faction name into the format example above the army list entry (in the Format Example it should be The New Rygolic Host)

  the unit info and autocomplete dont seem to work when no army name is entered in the first line. let's change this behaviour to autocomplete for units from every faction

  1. the SXY" value in the stat line is actually the spotting distance
  here is the stat line explanation:

  [Pasted text #6 +24 lines]

  and here is the weapon stat explanation:

  [Pasted text #3 +41 lines]

  [Pasted text #4 +31 lines]

  Smoke Launchers
  Gnd, R6”, A++/++, D1, Ammo 1
  Light Indirect, No CC, Smoke (4”),
  Turret
  This weapon’s Target statistic is Gnd;
  therefore, it is ground-targeting. It may auto-
  matically strike any point on the ground within
  its range, assuming it or a friendly unit can
  spot that point on the table.

  please check the tooltips and the definitions again to see if they conform to these rules

  5. can you remove the border, paddings and margins for the - and + buttons? can you please put the buttons around the UNIT INFO and VISUAL titles?

  4. I entered the rules
  rally_salt.txt moved to weapon abilities
  some caveats: some files (tercia.txt) are insanely long for a tooltip. I think they should have a link in the toolstip to a seperate rules page
  add this to the todo
  also, as a subpoint, add that I want to make and ascii version of the image in FM 100-4-8X page 71
  another subpoint: FM 100-3-8X p.68 image to ascii
